# CodeAlpha-Network-Sniffer

# Task 1: BASIC NETWORK SNIFFER
Build a network sniffer in Python that
captures and analyzes network traffic. 
This project will help you understand how data
flows on a network and how network packets
are structured.

## What is network sniffer?
A network sniffer, also known as a packet sniffer, is a tool used to capture, analyze, 
and monitor network traffic. It intercepts the data packets that are transmitted over a network,
allowing users to inspect the data and understand the flow of information.
## Installation
* install scapy module
* import necessary other modules seen on snippet code below
## Usage
* cd CodeAlpha-Network-Sniffer directory
* Run **Sudo python3 Packet-Sniffer.py** with full privilege
### Here's Snippet code
